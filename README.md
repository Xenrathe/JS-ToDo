# JS-ToDo

## To-do List:
- Button to clear localStorage
- Responsiveness for different layouts (convert font-size to rem, etc)
- Look at memory / graphic issue (causes hang? from animations?)
- Refactor to remove the null placeholders in project and todo
- Refactor for extensibility, etc
- Check comments for clarity
