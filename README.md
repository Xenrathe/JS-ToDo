# JS-ToDo

## To-do List:
- Adjust how priority works / make the initial pageload correctly place projects and todos in order
- Responsiveness for different layouts (convert font-size to rem, etc)
- Refactor to remove the null placeholders in project and todo
- Refactor for extensibility, etc
- Check comments for clarity
